## About

Milestone Project Two / Interactive Frontend Development / Code Institute

This website contains a simple single player memory game where the objective is to find and pair matches of the same animal in the 60 seconds given (as indicated by the timer).

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

This game is aimed at both children and adult looking for a simple and fun online game to pass thier time with.
The objective of the game is to remember the placement of the different tiles and find the matches within a time constraint wich is not only fun but great exercise for memory and cognition.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are blue (#1C7CCC) and a light blue(#c4f1ff) for the card border and background respectively.

        #### Typography
        -  A standard font has been used for the heading as well as the how to play info, as I wanted to keep the site clean and simple.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   The images that are used are very colorful and eye catching. I beleive that this is a great addition to the game as it allows for the player to remember the placement of the cards due to the eyecatching imagery used in the game.
    ### Wireframes
