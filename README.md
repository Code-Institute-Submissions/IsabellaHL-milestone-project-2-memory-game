## About

Milestone Project Two / Interactive Frontend Development / Code Institute

This website contains a simple single player memory game where the objective is to find and pair matches of the same animal in the 60 seconds given (as indicated by the timer).

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

This game is aimed at both children and adult looking for a simple and fun online game to pass thier time with.
The objective of the game is to remember the placement of the different tiles and find the matches within a time constraint wich is not only fun but great exercise for memory and cognition.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are blue (#1C7CCC) and a light blue(#c4f1ff) for the card border and background respectively.

        #### Typography
        -  A standard font has been used for the heading as well as the how to play info, as I wanted to keep the site clean and simple.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   The images that are used are very colorful and eye catching. I beleive that this is a great addition to the game as it allows for the player to remember the placement of the cards due to the eyecatching imagery used in the game.

2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
    - Alternatively Click [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/) for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
